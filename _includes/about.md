You're looking at the personal website for Joseph Atkins-Turkish, a programmer on a long-standing quest to actually keep all of his [projects](/projects) on one website for more than a year. This is my portfolio, but also as a space to share my thoughts on life, food, social issues, tech, and anything else.

My programming interests are primarily machine learning, web development, game development, using code to further the Forces of Good, and any/all intersections.

Here are some of my web identitites:

* I'm [Spacerat](https://github.com/Spacerat) on Github: 
* I'm [thespacerat](https://twitter.com/thespacerat) on Twitter (but I rarely tweet anything)
* Here's my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-atkins-turkish-47559275/).
* I'm also on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/joe-atkins-turkish) and [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004438125).
