For me, the phrase “pie dee over two squared times ell” - also known as “ell pie are squared” - evokes images of university lectures. Magnetic cylindrical rods, electric charge in a piece of wire - if you need to understand those things, you need to know how much space they take up in the world. From then until now, I don’t think I ever had to calculate the volume of a cylinder.

Recently I found myself making a pretty large quantity of apple butter. I can’t say I’m apple butter’s largest fan, but I’ve started cooking large amounts of stuff according to precise recipes and storing it all in glass jars at room temperature a.k.a. “canning”, and apple butter is a good introductory recipe.

The recipe looked simple enough; it’s basically apple sauce cooked for longer.  Boil 6 lbs of apples in 2 cups of apple cider for half an hour, blend it, then add 3 cups of sugar, some cinnamon and keep cooking for a few hours.

However, I hit a snag at the blend it stage. The recipe book suggested I transfer boiled apples to a blender or food mill for puréeing, then transfer it back to the pot. Such unnecessary effort! I’m pretty sure that immersion blenders had been invented by 2006 when this book was written.

I patted myself on the back as I transformed the contents of my pot of apples to mush and saved a significant quantity of cooking and washing labor, then I read on: “Measure 12 cups (3 L) of apple purée”.  Oy vey, it seemed that I would have to get a measuring jug out and dirty another dish anyway! The next step was to add sugar, but if I had too much apple purée the ratio of sugar to purée might be off and it there might not be enough sugar to preserve the final product.

Perhaps at this point you can guess what I did next. If you guessed “reach for the tape measure”, you guessed correctly. First I measured the height of the pot, starting from the top of the base.

Then I measured the distance between the top of the purée and the top of the pot.

Finally I measured the diameter of the pot.

The two vertical measurements gave me 23 - 17 = 6cm for the depth of the purée, so I plugged in all the numbers. (25cm/2)² ⨉ 𝜋 ⨉ (23 - 17) cm = 2945cm³! I had apparently managed to almost perfectly select the correct number of apples and volume of cider.  However, in retrospect I think I was being a bit cavalier with my measurements, rounding to the nearest 0.5 cm. If I were 0.25cm off the real measurements, how wrong could I be?

If my measurements overestimated the external height and diameter and underestimated the internal height all by 0.25cm, the real volume would have been (24.75 cm / 2)² ⨉ 𝜋 ⨉ (22.75 - 17.25) cm = 2646cm³, and I would have been 12% off the recipe. In the other direction, if the real volume were (26cm/2)² ⨉ 𝜋 ⨉ (23.25 - 16.75) cm = 3505cm³ I would have been 16% over!

That doesn’t seem so bad, but there was another mistake I could have made: if the tape measure was not perfectly vertical then I may actually have measured a the longest side of a triangle formed the side of the pan, the 1.5cm metal tip of the tape measure, and the tape itself, which would result in an overestimate.

Thankfully Pythagoras taught us that a² + b² = c². In the “reality was samller case”, where my 23cm outside pan measurement had been angled and overestimated by 0.25cm, the real height would actually be a = sqrt(22.75² - 1.5²) = 22.70 cm, and the loss of 0.05cm would bring the real volume from 2645 cm³. to 2622 cm³. Think about that 40cm³ difference as 20 little-finger-tip sized cubes.

In any case, later on I messed up by undercooking the apple butter by about 3 hours, noticing my mistake after canning about half of it into four 8oz jars, then cooking the rest for longer and canning it in five more 8oz jars, bringing me to 9 jars instead of the recipe-suggested 8, so all in all it was hard to know if I really got it right. But hey, at least I had fun. If you actually managed to get this far: thanks for your time!
