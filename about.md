You're looking at the personal website for Joseph Atkins-Turkish, a programmer on a long-standing quest to actually keep all of his projects on one website for more than a year.

It's fair to say that although I've been programming since I was 10, I'm fairly jack-of-all-trades so far (I only left college a year ago...). That being said, my programming interests are primarily game development, machine learning, web development, and any/all intersections.

Here are some of my web identitites:

* I'm [Spacerat](https://github.com/Spacerat) on Github: 
* I'm [joe-atkins-turkish](https://soundcloud.com/joe-atkins-turkish) on Soundcloud: 
* I'm [thespacerat](https://twitter.com/thespacerat) on Twitter (but I rarely tweet anything)
* I'm [Spacerat](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004438125) on Steam.
