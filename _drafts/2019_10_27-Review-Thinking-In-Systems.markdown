Intro

I read thinking in systems, it was influential:

- Properties of systems

  - Governed by feedback loops and delays
  - Growth is limited

- Well functioning systems

- Systems traps

  - Policy Resistence

    - Actors with opposing goals expand increasing energy on achieving them, with negative consequences.
    - Examples: war on drugs
    - Solution: back down; look for mutual goals to work for

  - Tragedy of the commons

    - Users benefit from a shared resource but share the costs of its abuse.
      - Examples:
        - dishwasher at work
    - Solutions:
      - educate users.
      - privatize or regulate

  - Drift to low performance

    - When performance standards can be set by past standards, and especially when perception of past performance skews bad, standards drop.
    - Examples:
      - ETL reliability
    - Solution: keep standards absolute, or only allow past performance to raise the standard.

  - Escalation

    - Actors try to build up more stock than the other, resorting to increasingly extreme means to do so.
    - Solution: Stop!

  - Success to the successful

    - The more you win, the more you win. In the end, there can only be a few winners.
    - Solutions: policies to limit total reward, level the playing field; or diversification - finding a new market

  - Shifting the burden to the intervenor

    - A solution resolves the symptoms of a problem but not the underlying cause. If the solution reduces the capacity of the original system to self maintain, dependence develops and the solution is increasingly required.
    - Solution: focus on building up self-reliance, then remove the intervenor.

  - Rule Beating

    - Rules can be "followed" in a way which don't achieve their true purpose or spirit.
    - Solution: understand rule-breaking as feedback for creating better rules

  - Seeking the wrong goals:
    - A system might be set up to achieve a goal which was not intended, if the wrong things are being measured.
      - Example: measuring profits instead of achievement of a mission
    - Solution: try to truly measure the goal. Measuring effort isn't enough, it will only produce effort.
