# Discovering self-help

Theme: things I've done to significantly improve my quality of life.

## Handbag

Problem: losing things

Discovery story: TODO

Identifying the real problems:
- Constantly transferring small objects between pockets provides many opportunities to lose things
- Pockets are not very secure
- Small objects are very easy to lose track of; leave somewhere, at a bar, on a table, etc.

Solution: handbag

- money, cards, ID, etc all in one, difficult-to-lose bag
- no longer transferring things between pockets
- not had a big loss since getting a handbag!
- huge bonus: carrying other things around...
    - Hand sanitizer
    - Facial tissues
    - A copy of the Constitution of the United States of America
    - Minty breath strips
    - A comb
    - Pens
    - Spare change
    - Scrunched up receipts
    - Headphones
    - My parka
    - A bottle of water
    - Things Iâ€™ve just bought
    - Shopping bags

Outcome:
- significantly reduced stress from losing wallets/etc
- ablility to carry things with me has lead to other things e.g. notebook (part 4)

## Household optimization

Problems:
- Time spent cleaning and tidying eroding any remaining time
- Very difficult to keep apartment clean/today

Discovery story: TODO

Identifying the real problem:
- Too much clutter, things I don't need
- Poor household organization. Things did not have 'their own place', they just went anywhere

Solution:
- I paid people to tidy my place!
- They basically did the Marie Kondo thing
- Turned closet full of empty boxes into walk in closet
- Helped to clear out huge quantity of stuff
- Since then: continued to do similar sessions
- including: clothes (using Marie Kondo's folding methods!), food (next post)

Outcome:
- Having a good space for clothes meant that clothes hanging around bedroom were more obviously out of place
- No more guilt associated with room full of boxes and broken stuff
- Things have place/homes (labels); easier to find stuff.
- Much less time spent tidying per week
- Able to think about further steps towards keeping a clean home, e.g. buying a vacuum cleaner, getting a labeler and labeling things myself

## Food expiry tracking

Probems:
- Throwing lots of expired food away
- Feels bad, waste of money
- Somehow seems like we don't have much to cook with despite

Discovery story: TODO

Identifying the real problem: TODO

Solution:
- Get a pantry tracking app (many options, I went with Bleep for android/iOS compatibility)
- Re-organize entire kitchen marie-kondo style, put everything into app
- Add things to app when buying them
- Use app to understand when thing are going to go bad; eat stuff before that happens.

Outcome:
- Massively reduced food waste, < guilt
- Knowing what's in kitchen wherever I am makes it much easier to plan meals or buy extra ingredients on the way home if needed

## Notebook

Problems:
- Ideas spinning around in head. Holding onto thoughts because I know I'll forget them if I don't write them down
- Not writing things down, forgetting good ideas.
- Losing track of time on macro scale. What have I done over the past weeks/months/etc?
- Procrastination. Not getting round to doing important tasks.

Discovery story: TODO
- Writing things down in phone, ad hoc
- Various apps
- TODO

Identifying the real problem: TODO

Solution:
- Paper notebook!
- TODO

Outcome:
