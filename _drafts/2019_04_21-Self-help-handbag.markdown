At some point in my life I guess I become an 'adult'. I left college. I become responsible for a home and a job, but most importantly, I began to take on the majority of the burden of responsibility for my own wellbeing.

Responsibility implies maintenance. Can you think anything a person might be responsible for which requires no effort to maintain? I can't! And we're not simply born ready to maintain all things - we learn.

Looking back over the past few years, I find some key moments where I've made some change to help me take responsibility for my own well-being; patching some flaw in my routine, simplifying some stressful aspect of my environment, or giving myself new tools to tackle the world.

Contemplating these changes together, I realized that they often built upon one another in ways I had never predicted at the time. There's something about this I find quite exciting. It's narrative. I'm reminded of the assertion by David D. Burns in _Feeling Good - The New Mood Therapy_ that "action precedes motivation" - by doing things we unlock an ability to do more.

In this series of blog posts I'm going to describe a journey of self-help and discovery through little. There's every chance that the thing's I've done will seem completely mundane since you and I don't share the same set of problems, but my hope is that these little stories might inspire you to make little changes yourself.

In this post, I begin with handbags.

--------------------


I have a history of losing things. When I put an object down I have to face up to the reality that there's a pretty good chance I'll never be able to find it again. Small objects on my person are prone to leaving my person.

I'd say that this caused me great anguish over the yeas, but actually I think a sort of stockholm-syndrome started to take over me. I came to accept that I was a person who loses things. I would lose my wallet - cash, cards, ID and all - and reassure myself: "it's in my nature to lose things".
