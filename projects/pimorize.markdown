Pimorize is an app I made which helps you memorize numbers (e.g. pi), by having them repeatedly dictated to you in my voice. Sounds like a terrible idea doesn’t it?

Quadris is a clone of Katharine Berry’s [Bitris](https://github.com/Katharine/Bitris), which is in turn an adaption of [Tringo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tringo) from Second Life. It was written using BlitzMax in 2010.
