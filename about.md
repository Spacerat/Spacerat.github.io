You're looking at the personal website for Joseph Atkins-Turkish, a programmer on a long-standing quest to actually keep all of his projects on one website for more than a year.

It's fair to say that although I've been programming since I was 10, I'm fairly jack-of-all-trades so far (I only left college a year ago...). That being said, my interests are primarily game development, machine learning, web development, and any/all intersections.
